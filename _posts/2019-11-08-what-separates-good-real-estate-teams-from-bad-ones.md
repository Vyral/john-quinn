Over the last 10 years or so, a common trend we’ve seen in the real estate industry is more teams doing business instead of individual agents.&nbsp;

Not all of these teams are the same, though. They can vary greatly, but there’s an unfortunate trend within this movement that’s happening: **The agent who’s the head of the team doesn’t deal with clients or customers anymore**—they let all the brand-new agents handle the buyers and sellers.

On my team, I’m personally involved in every single transaction when we sell a home. In fact, I’m usually the one who visits the house to see first-hand what the seller has to offer. I’ve been in the real estate business for 30 years and have handled over 3,000 transactions, but I’ve seen teams here in the Memphis area whose head agent doesn’t even have a year’s worth of experience.&nbsp;

Despite this, they still have 20 or so people working under them, which is an easy way to get business, but they’re not actually serving their clients, and those clients aren’t getting the service they’re looking for.&nbsp;

Not all real estate transactions go as smoothly as you’d like, but **on a team like ours, with an experienced agent such as myself running things, we know how to resolve problems quickly.&nbsp;**

The bottom line is that you need to make sure you have the right team behind you whether you’re buying or selling a home.
