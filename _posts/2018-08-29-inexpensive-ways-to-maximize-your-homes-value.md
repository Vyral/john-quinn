There are plenty of inexpensive things you can do around your home to maximize its value. Here are a few of our favorite tips:

**1. Paint the front door.** A lot of times, we forget what our front door looks like after a while. Since the sun and other elements can beat down on it and make it look rough, repainting your front door is a great idea.

**2. Power wash the front steps, driveway, and even the front of the house.**

**3. Put some new mulch down in your garden or around your shrubs.**

**4. Clean all of your windows inside and out.** This will make your home sparkle and bring more light into your house.

**5. Get the stuff out of our closets.** Recycle, reuse, or just throw it away. You’ll be amazed at how much better you feel just making sure your closets have space in them again.
