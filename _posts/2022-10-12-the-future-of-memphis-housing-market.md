Housing values have appreciated by double digits in the last two years—will this insane growth continue?&nbsp;

The average home price in Memphis is around $240,000, which is an all-time high. This was mainly due to low inventory and great interest rates, but now that mortgage rates are higher, growth will probably slow down. That being said, **home values will remain high as long as inventory stays low.&nbsp;**

Also, home prices remain reasonable in Memphis, unlike other large southern cities like Nashville and Atlanta. That means **you can still purchase a home here and lock in a low monthly payment.&nbsp;**

This remains a great time to buy or sell a home. If you have questions, please call or email me. I’d love to help\!
