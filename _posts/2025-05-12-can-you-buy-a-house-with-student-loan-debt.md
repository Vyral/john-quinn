Many potential homebuyers look at their student loan statements and wonder, ‘Will this debt keep me from ever owning a home?’ It’s a completely valid concern considering you’re looking at the possibility of taking on one major debt while still carrying another. Fortunately, thousands of people with student loans become homeowners every single year; According to the National Association of Realtors, 41% of first-time buyers under 37 carried student debt in 2023, with a median balance of $30,000. Meanwhile, an Education Data Initiative study found that 60% of millennials delay homeownership due to student loans—proving it’s possible, but often requires extra planning.

While your loans will factor into the equation, they don’t automatically disqualify you, they just mean you’ll need a more strategic approach. The key is understanding exactly how lenders view student debt and positioning yourself in the strongest possible way when you apply. Student loans influence these key factors in the mortgage approval process:

**1\. Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI).** Lenders evaluate whether your total monthly debt payments (including your potential mortgage) stay within acceptable limits. Most lenders prefer a DTI below 45%, meaning your debts should not consume more than 45% of your monthly income. A high DTI due to student loan payments may make it harder to qualify for a mortgage or reduce the amount you can borrow.

**2\. Interest Rates.** Borrowers with higher debt levels may be viewed as riskier by lenders, which can result in higher mortgage interest rates. Even a small rate increase can significantly impact affordability. For example, at a 6% interest rate, a 2000 monthly mortgage payment could finance a 2,000 monthly mortgage payment could finance a 333,000 home. If the rate rises to 7% due to debt risk, the same payment might only cover a $300,000 loan.

**3\. Credit Score.** Federal student loan payments have resumed, and missed payments or default can severely damage credit scores. Some borrowers have reported credit score drops exceeding 200 points due to delinquency. Maintaining on-time payments is essential to preserving creditworthiness when applying for a mortgage.

You’ll want to **plan your purchase a year in advance** if you’re considering any of the following strategies. It’ll spell the difference between renting indefinitely and owning your dream home.

First and foremost, focus on **reducing your existing student debt**. Even paying down one loan can significantly improve your debt-to-income ratio and potentially boost your credit score.

If you’re struggling to qualify on your own, bringing in a **creditworthy co-signer** (like a parent or spouse with strong finances) can provide the extra reassurance lenders need to approve your application.

Don’t overlook **down payment assistance programs** either; many state and local initiatives specifically help borrowers with student loans by reducing the amount you need to borrow upfront. And if you’ve fallen behind on payments, take immediate steps to **rehabilitate or consolidate defaulted loans**. Lenders typically want to see at least 12 months of on-time payments after rehabilitation before considering you for a mortgage.

Student loans don’t mean homeownership is inaccessible to you, but careful financial management is key to making this work. By understanding how lenders assess debt and taking steps to improve your financial profile, you can position yourself for a successful mortgage application.
