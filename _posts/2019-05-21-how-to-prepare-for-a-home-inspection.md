Once your home goes under contract, it’s time for the buyer to begin the inspection process. They’ll be hiring an inspector to come out and look through every nook and cranny of your home, listing every issue they can find along the way.&nbsp;

The fewer things they find, the better the buyer will feel about purchasing your home, which is why you want to prepare as much as possible before the inspector steps foot inside. **Here’s what you should do before an inspection:**

**1\. Service your HVAC system.** Call a professional to come out and take care of your heating and air units, even if it just means getting them cleaned up and looking good.

**2\. Change any burnt out light bulbs.** If you see any lights that are no longer working, replace them. If the inspector sees a light out, they can easily mark it down as an electrical problem.

**3\. Repair the exterior.** Take a walk around the perimeter of your home, keeping an eye out for rotting wood and peeling paint. Get these items repaired and repainted.

**4\. Check your faucets.** Turn the faucets in your kitchen, bathrooms, etc. on and off to see if the water starts and stops correctly. Do they stop automatically or do they drip a lot? If the latter happens, you may want to replace some washers. If the inspector finds it, they’ll be asking you to hire an expensive plumber to fix it.

**5\. Test and check your outlets.** Some power outlets might need to be changed, depending on their condition. If there are burn marks anywhere on the outlet, it’s a very good idea to replace it.

Completing these tasks around the home will go a long way toward ensuring you get a good inspection report on your property. If you anticipate there will be a lot of issues, it’s even a good idea to get your own pre-inspection before you list. **This way, you’ll have a complete idea of what’s wrong with your home and you can make repairs on your terms**—not on the terms of the buyer’s inspector.
