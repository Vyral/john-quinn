Receiving an offer is one of the most exciting aspects of selling your home. Of course, given that today’s real estate contracts can be several pages long, it’s important to have a real estate professional by your side. This way, you’ll know exactly what to expect at closing.

But having a real estate professional working on your behalf is important for another reason, too—**an experienced agent will help you negotiate with the buyer.**

When you work with our team, we’ll help you understand every aspect of the offer, and of the deal in general. We will also provide you with a “net sheet,” which is a document detailing exactly how much money you can expect to earn when the home closes.

Money isn’t the only aspect you must pay attention to, though. Terms and conditions are important as well. **Things like your move-out date, the course of action to follow the home inspection, and other critical factors of the deal will all be discussed during negotiations.**

The important thing when you review offers on your home is that you find one that matches up with your goals. Whether you receive one offer or 10, it’s important to partner with a Realtor and make sure that it will be a good deal for you.
