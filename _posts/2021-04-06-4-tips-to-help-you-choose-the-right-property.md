With inventory as little as it is in our market, it can be frustrating for buyers, and you may be tempted to buy any property you can get your hands on. There’s a better approach to choosing the right property, though, and it starts with these four tips.&nbsp;

**1\. Write down what you really want in your next home.** Make a list of ‘must have’ items and items you like but can do without and give that list to your agent.&nbsp;

**2\. Narrow down the location.** I’m sure you can find the perfect house, but if it’s in the wrong neighborhood, it’s not really the right house for you. I get a lot of calls from people who feel like they need to sell their house only a couple years after they bought it because they’ve decided it’s not close enough to where they work or their kids’ school. It costs a lot of money to do that, so narrow down which neighborhood you want to live in. You’ll likely be there for a while.

**3\. Ask questions about the houses you visit.** Most of the time, when buyers look at homes, they’re only there for 10 or 15 minutes. In that short time, there’s no way to learn everything you need to know about a home. Feel free to ask questions about the houses you visit and take a good look at them. Also, try checking out the property disclosures, and make sure you order a home inspection once you’ve made an offer.&nbsp;

**4\. Make sure you choose the right agent to guide you through the process.** Any agent can write up a contract, but not everyone will truly have your best interests at heart. A good agent will ensure you get the right house at the right location and the right price so you enjoy it for many years to come.&nbsp;

If you have questions about the home-buying process or there’s anything I can help you with, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to help you.
