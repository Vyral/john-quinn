Many people wonder if they’re able to sell their home as is. The simple answer is yes, but there are a few caveats to this.&nbsp;

When someone lists their home as is, they’re telling buyers that the home has problems. Essentially, buyers see it as a huge gamble — who knows what sorts of awful issues can be hidden throughout the home? **People aren’t willing to pay top dollar for these properties.**
