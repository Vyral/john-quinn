Should you get a pre-listing home inspection? Definitely\!&nbsp;

If you don’t get a pre-listing inspection, a buyer will have their own inspector come, and they’ll give you a lengthy list of things that need to be fixed on your house. This can botch a home sale for many reasons.&nbsp;

Usually, buyers will demand that professional electricians, plumbers, and so on do all of the work. However, when you get a pre-listing home inspection done, you are in charge of what gets taken care of, how it gets taken care of, and who does it. **You won’t have any shocks once the buyer’s inspection happens.&nbsp;**

The best thing to do is to get a home inspection on your house before you put it on the market. That way, you’ll know what needs to be done ahead of time. Unfortunately, too many home sellers wait to get things fixed until the buyer’s inspection and are upset by the amount of work that needs to be done and what the price tags are.&nbsp;

If you do your own inspection beforehand, you can go through the list of upgrades, choose the professionals to do the work, you won’t have a closing deadline to worry about, and you’ll end up saving money. Also, your real estate agent can help find contractors with fair prices.&nbsp;

Even if your home is only a couple of years old, **it’s critical to get a pre-inspection done.**
