Even in a hot market like this one, there are still homes that go unsold. To make sure a house sells the second time around, **it’s important to get an agent who can identify what the problem is.&nbsp;**

It could be anything from price, to condition, to unknown buyer turn-offs. The fixes could be quick and easy. You might just need a fresh coat of paint or some light staging.

Whatever the case may be, if your home went off the market unsold, I’d love to go through the house with you and get an in-depth look at what’s preventing the home from being a buyer's top choice and what we need to do to get it there.&nbsp;

If you have any questions for me, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I would love to hear from you.
