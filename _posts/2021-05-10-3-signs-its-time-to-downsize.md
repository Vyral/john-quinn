In many homeowners’ lives, it becomes clear that they just don’t need all the space they have in their homes. Here are a few signs that it might be time to downsize:

**1\. You’re getting close to retirement.** We find that many of our sellers are getting closer and closer to retirement age, and they feel that it’s just time to get out of the house and downsize. After all, all the kids have moved out, so they want something a bit smaller.

**2\. It’s difficult to keep up with housekeeping.** If you’re getting to the point where there’s just too much work to do around the house, like lawn care and general maintenance, it might be time to downsize.

**3\. There are financial opportunities.** Your home may have appreciated more in recent years than you realize, so selling your current one to buy a smaller one may loosen up a lot of money that you could put toward your retirement or other investments. Or better yet, you could buy a rental property with that passive income.

If you find that you’re ready to downsize or you have any questions about the process, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to hear from you.
