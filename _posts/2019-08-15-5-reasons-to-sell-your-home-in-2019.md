If selling your home has been on your mind, there’s no time like the present. Here are five reasons why you’ll want to do so in 2019:

**1\. Your home won’t be on the market for long.** Buyer demand is through the roof right now, so you won’t have to worry about your home spending weeks or months on the market.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>**2\. You’ll make a handsome profit\!** Home prices are going up, so by listing this year, you’ll be able to capitalize on that.&nbsp;

{% include pullquote.html %}

**3\. Homes priced under $300,000 are selling fast.** In particular, there’s a high demand for properties in the $300,000 price point, and they’re flying off the market as a result.&nbsp;

**4\. Mortgage rates are low.&nbsp;**

**5\. Millennials are flooding the market.** The heavy for housing demand we’re seeing is thanks in no small part to this wave of millennial buyers.&nbsp;

We have no idea what’s to come in 2020, so don’t let the opportunity to get the most out of the market this year pass you by\! If you have any real estate-related questions or would like more information, please give me a call at 901-591-8100. I look forward to hearing from you\!&nbsp;
