There are many misconceptions out there about the kind of credit score needed to qualify for a home purchase. In fact, a recent survey showed that 24% of all renters believed they needed a score above 700 to buy a home.

That’s simply not the case. We’ve been able to get people in homes with credit scores in the low 600s. Anything below that makes it really tough to get a house.

**If you do have a high credit score of 750 or above, you’ll be able to qualify for pretty much any type of loan.** When your score dips to the 600s or 500s, it becomes more difficult for you to find a mortgage.

We’ve worked with a ton of homebuyers helping them improve their credit score. It takes a little bit of time, but it’s worth it in the long run. **The higher your credit score, the lower your interest rate will be.**

If you need help improving your credit or have any questions about buying a home, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. We’d love to hear from you.
