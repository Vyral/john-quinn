There’s no doubt about it: The market is *hot*. This is probably the lowest inventory that Memphis has seen in decades, which means houses are flying off the shelves quickly, often with multiple offers. The best part is that interest rates are historically low; **you can get a 30-year loan for just 3% interest**—truly incredible if you think about it. Even though prices are going up, these low rates will guarantee you a low monthly payment when you decide to buy. If you’ve been thinking about buying a house, now is the time to move\!&nbsp;

If ever I can be of assistance to you or you have questions about buying or selling in this market, please reach out to me by phone or email. I’m always happy to have a one-on-one chat.
