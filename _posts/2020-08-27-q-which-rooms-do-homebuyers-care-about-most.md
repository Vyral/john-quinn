Homebuyers all have something specific they’re looking for in a new home and, as it turns out, there are two rooms that homebuyers pay attention to the most when they’re shopping to buy a home: the kitchen and the bathroom. So, if you plan to do renovations on your house to maximize its value before you sell it, you’ll want to concentrate your money and efforts on those two areas.

Let’s start with the kitchen. The kitchen is the place where most of your company is going to gather on the holidays and special occasions, so **buyers are looking for a nice, spacious, up-to-date kitchen that they can show off to their friends and family.** Make sure you have nice cabinets, countertops, and tile/wood flooring; get the old linoleum and vinyl flooring out of there.

As far as the master bathroom goes, buyers know that they’ll be spending a lot of their time in there, as well. One of the most important things to address in your bathroom if you want to sell your home for the most money possible is to get rid of any carpet you have in there. **A lot of older homes also have low countertops; it’s a good idea to take those out and get the higher ones they make nowadays and put a nice slab of granite on top.** You’ll be amazed at how much you’ll enjoy your bathroom yourself before you sell it.

Hopefully, these tips will help you sell your home for the maximum price\! If you’d like more tips or if you have any questions, don’t hesitate to reach out to us.
