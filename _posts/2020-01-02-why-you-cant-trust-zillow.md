Is Zillow a good resource for figuring out your home’s value before you sell?

If you’re shopping for homes, Zillow’s a great place to get information for all homes on the market—a lot of buyers use the site. The reality, though, is that Zillow’s Zestimates are calculations done by an algorithm that’s based on other nearby homes, which means they can be off by anywhere from 5% to 15%.&nbsp;

Furthermore, Zillow doesn’t actually come out to your house and take a look at it. A professional real estate agent, on the other hand, will visit your house and factor in things such as the age of your appliances, or whether your heating and air conditioning unit is up to code.&nbsp;

That’s why, **when looking for a true, accurate estimate of your home’s value, you’re better off calling an agent who does business in your area.** In addition to your house, they’ll also know about the local schools, neighborhoods, shopping centers, etc. This extra information can add thousands of dollars to your bottom line when it’s time to sell.&nbsp;
