If you're like most homebuyers, you have two primary considerations. First, how can you find the perfect home? Second, can you get that home for the lowest possible price? It takes skill to do both at the same time. To make that happen, you first have to understand how sellers price homes.

Sellers want to get as much money as possible. **Many sellers would like to price their home way above market value, hoping that a buyer will pay that kind of a price.** We want to make sure that when you are shopping for a house, you do your research and find out what it’s really worth.&nbsp;

On the other hand, buyers want to get the house for the lowest price possible. In a hot seller’s market, a lot of buyers find a perfect home only to end up in a multiple-offer situation. How can a buyer win a multiple-offer situation without breaking the bank? The first step is to call an experienced real estate agent.&nbsp;
