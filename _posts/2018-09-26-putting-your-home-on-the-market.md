Before you put your home on the market, you should take an objective look at your house. Because we are familiar and comfortable with our homes, we often overlook the small things that a potential buyer will catch: A burnt out lightbulb, scuffs on a wall, or a yard in need of trimming.

When evaluating your home for sale, try to imagine yourself as a potential buyer. **See your home through that buyer’s eyes:** do the sidewalks and driveway need a power-wash? Could the siding use a fresh coat of paint?

**Make every part of your home as spacious as possible.** Especially consider your closets. If a potential buyers looks in your closets and sees them full of your things, they will likely imagine your closets are no more spacious than their own. A good rule of thumb is to clear half of your things from each closet. The more spacious your closets and other rooms appear, the more attractive your home will be.

**Clear out your storage spaces.** Attics, basements, and garages can accumulate quite a bit of clutter over the years. Before you list your home, you should go through all your storage spaces with an eye toward clearing away things that you don’t need. As above, the more spacious and organized your storage spaces appear, the more attractive your home.

Finally, **have your home cleaned by professionals.** The $200 to $300 dollars you spend on a professional cleaning service will be worth it. Hiring a group of professionals to clean your home top to bottom will insure potential buyers are seeing your home at its impressive best.
