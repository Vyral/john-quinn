When purchasing a home, there’s more than just the sales price of the house to consider—there are actually quite a few hidden costs that most buyers need to know about before they submit an offer on a home: appraisal fees, moving fees, tax service fees, title insurance, and more.

On average, the typical closing cost on a home can equal almost 4% of the sales price. If you’re buying a $200,000 home, those costs can be upwards of $8,000. For a $500,000 home, they can be around $15,000.

Suffice it to say that there are many costs involved with the homebuying process. If you’d like a quick breakdown of what costs you can expect to pay in the specific price range you’re searching in, don’t hesitate to reach out to me.
