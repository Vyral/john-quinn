Not all real estate agents are made the same, so it’s important that you ask a few questions before choosing one to represent you as a homebuyer or seller. Depending on the responses you receive, you can ensure yourself a great real estate experience (or at least avoid a not-so-great one). **Here’s what to ask an agent:**

**1. Do you work independently or as a team?** When your agent works in a team, there are always members around who can help you out when your agent is busy. If your agent works alone, they aren’t able to handle the many needs that you and other clients have.

**2. What experience do you have?** In this profession, there are many agents who have been in the business for decades, but they generally haven’t sold many homes throughout that period. You want an agent who has been in business for a long time and sells many homes on a continuous basis. Real estate is constantly changing, so agents who are inconsistent in their careers are unable to stay up to date.

**3. Do you have an exit program?** A lot of agents want to tie you up in a contract for months and months, even if they’re performing underwhelmingly. We provide a risk-free listing program that allows clients to end their contract with us at no cost. This way, you know we’re doing our best to earn your business each day.

**4. How much will I net when my home is sold?** All too often, agents will list people’s homes without telling them how much they’ll actually receive when the home is sold. Then, when the home goes to closing, they find they’re not getting what they were expecting from the sale. Make sure your agent provides a net sheet that explains the financial details.

**5. Can I see your list of references?** You want to call references who can vouch for your agent. Reviews on sites such as Zillow can be good, but these reviews may sometimes be created by individuals who haven’t actually worked with the agent.

If you have any questions or need further information, feel free to call us at [**901-591-8100**](tel:901-591-8100){: target="_blank"}. We look forward to hearing from you.
