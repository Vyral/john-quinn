When it comes to renovating your home, you can spend a lot of money without actually increasing its value. 

One of the biggest mistakes homes sellers make when remodeling is **not taking a moment to reflect on why they want to make renovations in the first place.** Ask yourself—are you making renovations because you like them and want to stay in your home or because you want to get your home ready to sell? If you’re renovating to sell, focus on the basics that will appeal to the most buyers. For example, keep your home’s paint colors neutral and avoid adding your own color preferences.

Another huge mistake sellers make is **overlooking major repairs that need to be taken care of.** I once went to a home where the owner remodeled everything but forgot to update the 40-year-old roof. Even though it hadn’t been leaking, it was still going to cost $15,000 to repair and they already spent their entire renovation budget. 

This kind of oversight will really hurt you in the long run, so before you decide to spend thousands of dollars in renovations, give me a call. I’d be glad to visit your home, give you a free consultation detailing the necessary steps to sell it, and help you decide which kinds of renovations you should make. 

As always, if you have questions about this or any real estate topic or are thinking of buying or selling a home soon, don’t hesitate to reach out to me as well. I’m happy to help.
