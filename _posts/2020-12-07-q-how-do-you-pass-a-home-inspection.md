When putting your house on the market, one of the biggest deal-killers is often the home inspection. So what do you need to know if you want to pass the inspection?

First, **check to see if you have any rotten wood** that needs to be taken care of. Rotten siding, etc., can be a real stumbling block for the buyers looking to purchase your house.

Also, is your roof brand-new or is it a bit older? **Most people can tell if your roof is old**, so you might consider getting it updated or replaced.
