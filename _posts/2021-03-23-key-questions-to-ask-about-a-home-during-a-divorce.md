Unfortunately, divorce is one of the main reasons why many people sell their homes. When it comes to getting a divorce, many questions need to be answered: Who will keep the house? Should both of you retain the title, or should you sell it and divide up the proceeds? Another thing that people often overlook when going through a divorce is whether or not one party should refinance the house to get the spouse who is leaving off the mortgage? We can help provide guidance on these fronts.
