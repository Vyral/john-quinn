Some of the least expensive and most dramatic changes you can make to your house involve paint and carpets.&nbsp;

If you’ve lived in your home for 10, 20, or even 30 years and haven’t repainted or installed new carpet, you should consider doing so if you plan on putting your home on the market to make it show well.&nbsp;

When painting, make sure the transition between the trim and the walls has smooth, straight lines. **If you’re not confident in your painting ability, hire a professional painter.** They’ll take care of this important detail, and buyers will notice that your home has been professionally painted.

If you can just steam-clean your carpet to make it look brand new, that’s great, but most homes I visit have carpet that’s been there for five to 15 years, and steam-cleaning won’t do the job in this case.&nbsp;

If you’re in a similar situation, **you’ll have to replace your carpet entirely, and I suggest using a single, neutral color for every room.** Don’t go cheap, but you don’t have to get expensive either. Just install a nice carpet with a good pad that buyers will notice when they walk through the home. If they see you’ve spent good money on the carpet, that could be the deciding factor in them choosing your house over a similar house with old carpet.&nbsp;

These two tasks will give you the edge over your competition when you put your home on the market.&nbsp;
