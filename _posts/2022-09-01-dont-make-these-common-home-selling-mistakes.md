Preparing your home for the market is hard enough as it is. Let’s lower your stress by avoiding the six most common mistakes people make when getting their homes ready to sell.

**Mistake No. 1: Not making the simple repairs.** It’s easy to put off simple repairs—life just gets in the way. Nail holes, scuffs, drippy sinks, and dead bushes can all be fixed quickly, and taking care of them freshens up your home.

**Mistake No. 2: Neglecting to declutter your home.** I recently viewed a listing with all kinds of trinkets, pictures, and collectibles on the shelves, which took away from showing the property. Decluttering your home is super important; some buyers won’t even visit a messy house.

**Mistake No. 3: Restricting access.** Allowing buyers to see your home is critical. Limiting when buyers can view your home can lower your chances of selling. More showings lead to more offers, stronger competition, and better results. Try to be as accommodating as possible.&nbsp;

**Mistake No. 4: Getting too emotionally involved.** Most people are attached to their homes. However, when it’s time to sell, you need to think of it as a property. It’s a product that will go on the market and compete with other products. The people looking at your home don’t share your memories, so if they’re willing to pay what you want, let it sell.

**Mistake No. 5: Overpricing your home.** Everyone talks about the outrageous prices sellers have gotten for their homes. Whether the market is hot or not, pricing your home correctly takes skill. Both overpricing and underpricing can lose you money, so look at all the numbers before you list your home.

**Mistake No. 6: Picking the wrong agent.** As the market heated up, lots of new agents got into the business. I completely understand wanting to help a friend or family member, but when you’re negotiating for the most important investment you own, you need an experienced agent to fight for you. Pick someone with a proven track record so you can get the most out of this market.
