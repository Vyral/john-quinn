Over the last few years, Memphis has been in a strong seller’s market. One of the only problems sellers face in this market is what to do when there are multiple offers on the home.&nbsp;

Do you take the highest price? The best terms? **Those are really good questions, and it’s one of the reasons why we create an entire spreadsheet for our clients that spell out all the offers they receive and how they differ.** We don’t always recommend taking the highest offer. Some offers are too good to be true, and you won’t find out which ones those are unless your agent does their due diligence.

We weigh everything from price to net profit, probability of close, and type of financing. **There are so many different factors to consider in an offer to determine which is best for you.**

The John Quinn Home Selling Team is full of home-selling experts and we take pride in our ability to get our clients the most possible money for their home and the most favorable terms. If you have any questions for us about the market or selling a home, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
