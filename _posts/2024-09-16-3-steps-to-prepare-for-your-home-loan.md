Are you ready to trade in your rent payments for shiny new house keys? If you're considering buying a home with a loan, you’ve got some financial prepping. But don’t worry; with these three essential steps, you’ll be ready to breeze through the financing process like a pro:

**1\. Reduce debt.** Lenders generally look for a debt load of no more than 36% of your income. This figure includes your mortgage, which typically ranges from 25% to 28% of your net household income. So, you'll need to get monthly payments on the rest of your installment debt—like car loans, student loans, and revolving balances on credit cards—down to between 8% and 10% of your net monthly income.

**2\. Save for a down payment.** Designate a certain amount of monthly money to put into your savings account. Although getting a 5% down or less mortgage is possible, you can usually get a better rate if you put down a more significant percentage of the total purchase. Aim for a 20% down payment. Also, don't forget to factor in closing costs, which can average between 2% and 7% of the home price.

**3\. Obtain a copy of your credit report and establish a good credit history.** Make sure your credit report is accurate and correct any errors immediately. A credit report provides a history of your credit, bad debts, and any late payments. Get a credit card and make payments by the due date. Do the same for all your other bills, too. Pay off the entire balance as promptly as possible.
