A lot of brokerages say they’ll sell your home with little cost to you. If you can sell a home for only a low $100 to $500 fee, why wouldn’t you? That’s a huge savings\!

**This way of thinking is exactly how discount brokerages draw people in.** I’ve seen many of these brokerages come and go throughout the years, and there’s a reason why they aren’t around for long. Their agents provide limited services, which means your home may not even sell. If it does, it likely won’t be for as much as you’d receive from a better brokerage.

Discount brokerages are typically filled with agents who don’t want to do the work. You might get a “for sale” sign in your yard, but don’t expect any further marketing for your listing.&nbsp;

Even worse, since these agents don’t receive much commission for selling your home, they have no incentive to get your home sold at a high price. By paying a slightly higher rate to an experienced agent who has your best interests in mind, you’ll see better rewards. **They’ll negotiate on your behalf to ensure your home sells for more.**

Ultimately, a discount brokerage does little for your home sale. Why pay them when they leave you with all the heavy lifting of marketing and finding buyers?

The better option is to take advantage of the services offered by an experienced Realtor. If you have any questions or would like to talk about buying or selling a home, feel free to reach out to me. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
