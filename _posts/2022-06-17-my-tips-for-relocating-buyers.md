Are you moving to a new city and want to keep the bumps in the road to a minimum? When moving to another town, you’re faced with several more moving challenges than if you were to just move locally. What should you do if you have limited knowledge of the vendors necessary to help you complete your move?&nbsp;

Your first instinct might be to reach out to a local lender. However, most of them are only licensed in the state where they’re doing business. If you’ve used the same local lender over the years, giving your info to a stranger over the phone can be unnerving. I recommend reaching out to your local lender and asking them for a recommendation from their network. **National lenders can help, but they won’t give you the same level of service.**

Next, you’ll want to get your new home connected to your utilities, cable, electricity, and more. Your new place won’t function until you have these things turned on. Some cities have a one-stop shop for gas, lights, and water. In other cities, there are separate companies for each utility.&nbsp;

On top of this, getting your internet set up or finding a reputable school or ideal grocery store all contribute to creating a comfortable environment, but how can you accomplish this if you haven’t moved yet?&nbsp;

**This is where a reputable real estate agent comes in handy.** If you know people in the area you’re moving to, ask them to direct you to a top agent, or ask your current agent if they have someone in their network who can help you set up your basic utilities and other needs in your new city. Try to limit the amount of stress in your move by hiring a trustworthy, experienced agent like myself.

I’ve made friends with agents all over the country, and I can help connect you with someone even if you’re moving out of the area. If you have any questions about making your move to or from Memphis, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
