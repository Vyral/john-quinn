In 2020, most predictions were thrown out the window because this year has been very bizarre for everyone. However, I wanted to offer my predictions for how the rest of the 2020 real estate market may go.&nbsp;

I believe our Memphis market will remain strong. Of course, **it’s always possible the presidential election could change things.** What we do know is that prices are increasing and buyers are receiving historically low interest rates. Though prices are rising quickly and some buyers are waiting for them to decrease, prices will likely either increase more or remain the same.&nbsp;

If you’re considering buying a home, now is the time to do it. If you’re thinking about selling a house, now is also an excellent time because buyers will be competing for it. In this market, you’ll get multiple offers, and that’s the best position to be in as a seller.&nbsp;

If you have any questions or need my help, call or email me. I would love to assist you.
