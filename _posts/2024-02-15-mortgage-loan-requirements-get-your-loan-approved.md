When applying for a mortgage loan, lenders usually request various documents for assessment before approving your application. Here is a list of the documents that you generally need to provide:&nbsp;

**1\. W-2 tax returns or business tax returns.** You should always expect to provide documentation of your long-term income, regardless of whether you are traditionally or self-employed.

**2\. Pay stub.** For each person signing the loan, include at least one pay stub. Pay stubs offer insight into your current income and employment status for additional verification.

**3\. Credit card information.** You need to provide the account numbers for all your credit cards, along with the amounts of any outstanding balances.

**4\. Bank and credit union statements.** Submit four monthsâ€™ worth of statements for both your checking and savings accounts.

**5\. Loan details.** Include loan numbers and amounts owed on installment loans like student loans and car loans.

**6\. Residential history.** Provide the address where you've lived for the past 5 to 7 years, along with the names of landlords.&nbsp;

**7\. Brokerage account statements.** If applicable, submit brokerage account statements for the past two to four months, as well as a list of any other major assets of value, such as a boat or RV, and stocks or bonds not held in a brokerage account.

**8\. Retirement account statements.** Include your most recent 401(k) or other retirement account statements.

**9\. Documentation to verify additional income,** such as child support or pension.
