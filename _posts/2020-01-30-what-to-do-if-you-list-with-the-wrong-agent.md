If you listed your home with the wrong agent, what do you do? Can you get out of your contract with that agent?

First, a disclosure: I’m not going to advise anyone on how to get out of their contract with their agent. I will, however, let you know that when people list with me, I let them know right up front that **we offer risk-free listings. If you’re not satisfied with our work, then you can get out of the contract for free.** Most agents don’t work that way; once you sign the contract, you’re stuck for six months to a year.

Before you even put your house on the market these days, **you should check with your agent about whether or not you’re allowed to get out of the contract if you don’t get the results you’re expecting.** The best way to protect yourself in those situations is to get some form of written affirmation that if they don’t perform, you can leave the contract. That way, you won’t have to call other agents like me for advice on abandoning a contract. As much as I appreciate the calls, there’s not a lot I can do if you’ve already signed a contract with an agent who can’t perform.

If you’re looking for an agent to assist you with your next transaction and you don’t want to be locked in if the agent doesn’t perform to your satisfaction, reach out to me. With our risk-free listings, you won’t be locked in a transaction you don’t like, and I promise to deliver on the results you’re looking for. I look forward to hearing from you soon\!
