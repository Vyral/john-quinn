Here’s a common dilemma: You want to buy a house, but you have one you need to sell, too. However, you don’t want to sell your current property without buying the new one first because **you don’t want to end up temporarily homeless**. In a hot market, which we’re in right now, it’s fairly easy to find a new house and get your current property sold without worrying whether it will sell or not. However, in a typical market or buyer’s market, that’s one of the main issues sellers face.&nbsp;

**This is a classic catch-22**. The answers to this problem are complex and depend on many factors. One of the things we do is offer a trade-up program; if you buy a home from us and you also need to sell, this program guarantees a price that your house will sell for or we will purchase it at closing. Then you’re free to buy your next property.&nbsp;

If you’re interested in our trade-up program, please give us a call or [visit our website](https://www.johnquinnrealestate.com/). While you’re there, **check out the other programs we offer.** One of them may be right for you. Also, if you have any questions, reach out to us. We would love to help you.
