Nowadays, with the internet, it’s so convenient to visit a website to find real estate information. However, the problem that we're finding with companies like Zillow and Realtor.com is that the information they supply is not very accurate.

{% include pullquote.html %}

If you really want to find the market value of your home or another home you’re interested in, it’s important to call the real estate agent who listed it or find the information on their website. Almost every real estate agent's website will have a direct feed to the Multiple Listing Service, which means that the information is accurate. Other third-party sites don’t have access to this, so their information isn’t always up to date.

**If you need to find a home’s true value, reach out to a real estate agent you trust and talk to them, as opposed to someone from a company that doesn’t actually work in real estate.** If you have any questions for me, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you.
