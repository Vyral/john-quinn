There are a lot of upgrades you can make to your home, but spending a lot of money on them doesn’t always work out. Spending a lot of money on professional landscaping, for example, won’t result in a dollar-for-dollar return.&nbsp;

**Adding a new roof, new gutters, or a swimming pool will raise your home’s value, but it won’t translate into more money for you when you sell.** A new roof may take $10,000 to install, but it won’t bring an extra $10,000 of value to your home.

When most buyers shop for a house, they expect you to have a good roof in the first place. The same goes for your HVAC and plumbing systems.

If you have any questions about what you can do to your home to bring the highest possible return on investment, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
