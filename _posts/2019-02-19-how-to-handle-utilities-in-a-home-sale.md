If you’ve sold your home and are ready to move out, there are a few things you need to do in regard to your utilities.

Most of the time, you want to allow the utilities to stay on for a few days after closing, but make sure to let your gas, electric, and water companies know you’re moving out. These extra days **give you some breathing room in case things go wrong in your home sale.**

This also gives the buyer enough time to get things switched over into their name—you don’t want them to be greeted by the dark when they begin their move.

Remember to resolve services outside of your utilities, such as cable, internet, and landline phones. You should either end them or have them transferred to your new home.

Have all the arrangements taken care of before moving into your new home so you—like the buyer of your previous home—aren’t left without power.

**One of your biggest priorities should be getting homeowners insurance.** It’s usually required anyway when you get a loan, but you should always shop around to find the best deal. Do not cancel this on your previous home until after closing is complete and you’ve received money for the property. Once the money is in your hand, it’s no longer your house. But if something happens before this and you’ve already canceled your insurance, **you’re in a bad situation.**
