Before you hire an agent to sell your house, there are some important questions you’ll need to ask them. The first is, “What makes you different and why?” Other questions include, “What are the terms of the listing contract?” and “What’s your track record?” You want to be prepared before you even interview an agent to hire so you make the right decision.
