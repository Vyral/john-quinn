Today’s market has been white-hot, and a big reason why is all the investors buying homes for cash as is. If you have been approached with an instant offer from an investor, should you take it?

For some sellers, it’s a great opportunity. For others, it’s a trap. **The key difference is knowing how much your home is worth on the market.** If you can get top dollar for your home, there is no reason to undersell your home for immediate cash.&nbsp;

If you have questions about how much your home is worth, I’m here to help. I can come to your home and help you determine how much your home could be worth on the open market. For example, if your home only needs a few small repairs, I can help you make a plan to get the most money out of your property. However, if your home needs costly repairs, it may be a good idea to sell to an investor.&nbsp;

Whichever option is right for you, it can be hard to tell which repairs are small and which are big. If you find yourself struggling to make that determination, I would be more than happy to come out to your home for a complimentary consultation. I can tell you what repairs would cost, how much a local investor would pay for your home, how much an outside investor would pay, and even how much I would pay. No matter what option is right for you, I will make sure you get top dollar for your home.

If you have questions about selling your home as is, or if you have any other real estate questions, feel free to reach out to me. I am always ready to help.
